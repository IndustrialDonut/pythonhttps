Asymmetric encryption
Giving a public key, getting back an encrypted symmetric key to be decrypted by your private key - this solves the problem of a spy that
watches everything that is on a transmision line. Your data will be safe, in that sense,

Steps would be:
1. Person A encrypts message with B public key
2. Person B decrypts message with B private key
3.
